#CMPS 109 Summer 2017

I worked on this project alone.
I thought it was an interesting excersise in inheritence.
I do have to say I like working with GUI stuff in Java better
but thats completely my own bias.

I got most everything to work. It has trouble with one of the
test examples, but I found no other glitches.
