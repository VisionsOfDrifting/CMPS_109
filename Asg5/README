This program was completed using pair programming.
Partner: Mikhail Lychagin (mlychagi@ucsc.edu)
Partner: Nicholas Pappas (nhpappas@ucsc.edu)

We acknowledge that each partner in a programming pair should
drive roughly 50% of the time the pair is working together, and
at most 25% of an individual's effort for an assignment should
be spent working alone. Any work done by a solitary programmer
must be reviewed by the partner. The object is to work
together, learning from each other, not to divide the work into
two pieces with each partner working on a different piece.

Mikhail Lychagin spent  __7__ hours working alone.
Nicholas Pappas spent   __7__ hours working alone.
We spent                __4__ hours working together.
Mikhail Lychagin spent  __2__ hours driving.
Nicholas Pappas spent   __2__ hours driving.
