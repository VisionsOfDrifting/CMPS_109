This program was completed using pair programming.
Partner: Kevin Crum (kbcrum@ucsc.edu)
Partner: Nicholas Pappas (nhpappas@ucsc.edu)

We acknowledge that each partner in a programming pair should
drive roughly 50% of the time the pair is working together, and
at most 25% of an individual's effort for an assignment should
be spent working alone. Any work done by a solitary programmer
must be reviewed by the partner. The object is to work
together, learning from each other, not to divide the work into
two pieces with each partner working on a different piece.

Kevin Crum spent        __10__ hours working alone.
Nicholas Pappas spent   __10__ hours working alone.
We spent                __4_ hours working together.
Kevin Crum spent        __2__ hours driving.
Nicholas Pappas spent   __2__ hours driving.

Everything seems to be running smoothly. Except for two things
you cannot cd into ".." which is very frustrating. However,
if you were in /test you could cd / and you would be in the
root directory, so it does work with some bugs.

Also if you try to remove a file it will deduct from the size
of the directory when you ls it, but the name of the removed
directory and its information remain.

Thats about it, this project turned out a lot better than the
last one.
