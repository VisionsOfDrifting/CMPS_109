This program was completed using pair programming.
Partner: Kevin Crum (kbcrum@ucsc.edu)
Partner: Nicholas Pappas (nhpappas@ucsc.edu)

We acknowledge that each partner in a programming pair should
drive roughly 50% of the time the pair is working together, and
at most 25% of an individual's effort for an assignment should
be spent working alone. Any work done by a solitary programmer
must be reviewed by the partner. The object is to work
together, learning from each other, not to divide the work into
two pieces with each partner working on a different piece.

Kevin Crum spent        __7__ hours working alone.
Nicholas Pappas spent   __10__ hours working alone.
We spent                __6_ hours working together.
Kevin Crum spent        __2__ hours driving.
Nicholas Pappas spent   __4__ hours driving.

I think everything is working as it should be. Going to run the
tests on it before I submit, but as of now there are no known
bugs.
